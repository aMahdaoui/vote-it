# Vote-it

Vote-it is a react application for learning React JS, that provides a list of topics (items) to vote on in a simple manner and allow also users to add new items to the list and vote on existed ones.  
The first part contains preset items in the state directly, thats only for understand the logic of the app and to get started with react, however in the second part we get all items from firebase database, any added item will be stored automatically on firebase, then listed with the others items, what make our application a real time apps
